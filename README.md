# SIIM-RSNA-Covid-19-Object-Detection
Capstone Project: SIIM-RSNA-Covid-19 Object Detection (Computer Vision, Object Detection)

This repo contains my work for the SIIM-RSNA-Covid-19 Object Detection challenge. The goal of this was to use deep learning to classify lung X-ray scans (DICOM images) into 1 of 3 classes and specify bounding boxes around the areas of infections for Covid-19 patients. We tested the YOLO v5 and Faster-RCNN models for this project, with monitoring through Weights and Biases.
